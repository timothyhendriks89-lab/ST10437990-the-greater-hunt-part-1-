overview 

i built The Greater Hunt, a fantasy-style online store that feels like a medieval guild hall I focused on making it more than just shopping the idea was to mix storytelling with e-commerce so people feel like adventurers when choosing gear like weapons, armor, potions, and survival items
I set out who the site is for  mainly gamers, roleplayers and fantasy fans  and made sure the layout had clear product categories, a blog with lore and themed pages like the “Guild Scrolls” for enquiries

Design-wise, I went with a dark fantasy look using black, grey, red, green and gold to keep it immersive.
On the technical side I structured it with HTML, planning to use WooCommerce or Shopify for the store.
I also mapped out the file structure and an 8-week timeline from design mockups to launch
